  Evaluating neighborhoods with abundant greenery.
  
  Investigating affordability in areas adorned with lush green trees.
  
  Exploring potential correlations between rent prices, tree density, and the frequency of 311 complaints.
  
**4. Visualizing Data**:

  We employed data visualization techniques to provide insights into:
  Prevalent complaints in immediate areas.
  
  Correlation analysis between rent prices, tree abundance, and complaint occurrences.
  
  Assessing whether higher rent equates to fewer issues and complaints.
  
  Examining recent 311 incidents reported in the immediate vicinity.
  
  Identifying areas actively striving to enhance the presence of trees in the neighborhood.
  
  Our exploration and visualization endeavors are aimed at not only understanding the intricacies of choosing a new residence but also at deriving meaningful insights for informed decision-making in the realm of apartment hunting in the vibrant landscape of New York City.
